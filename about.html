## About

Hello, I'm Alan Bara. I like to mess with stuff. Been modding games, hacking mobile and Windows games and apps, programming AVRs, and developing Windows, Linux and Android apps. Always looking for a new interesting project.<br/>
Some games I used to mod:<br/>
-Little Fighter 2<br/>
-Lemming Ball Z<br/>
-Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and Black Ops<br/>
-MTA: SA<br/>

Guess I can't really tell you what games and apps I hacked <i class="fas fa-grin-squint-tears"></i>
